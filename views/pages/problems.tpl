        <h3>Dehydration</h3>
        <p>Both overwatering and under-watering will cause damage to the root system and eventually lead to dehydration. Your orchid is dehydrated when you see that the leaves are leathery and wrinkled.</p>
        <p>Solution: water once a week or only when the medium is dry, only use potting medium recomended such as bark. Decayed/old medium will suffocate roots.</p>

        <h3>Mealybugs</h3>
        <p>mealybugs are common insects that tend to live together in clusters in inaccessible parts of plants, such as leaf axils, leaf sheaths, between twining stems and under loose bark. </p>
        <p>Solution: Manual removal with a cotton bud and repotting, pesticides and repotting.</p>

        <h3>Aphids</h3>
        <p>Among the most common orchid pests, aphids are slow-moving, soft-bodied insects related to scale. Usually less than 1/8-inch long, greenish white or black, aphids have soft, pear-shaped bodies, long legs, antennae, and sucking mouthparts to feed on plant juices.</p>
        <p>Easily removed/killed by spraying affected area with water and using soap bubbles. </p>

        <img src="./orchid-images/burn.jpg" alt="Sunburn" style="width:100%">
        <h3>Dehydration</h3>
        <p>Many times, a burn will look black or yellow, as a rounded spot in the middle of a leaf at its highest point. Over time, the burn spot will turn white and papery surrounded by an undamaged looking green leaf.</p>
        <p>Solution: keep plant out of direct hot sun, do not allow orchid leaves to touch the glass of a hot window or have water on the leaves in bright sun.</p>
